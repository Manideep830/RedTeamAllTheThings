**About**

Welcome to Red Teaming Resources, a comprehensive repository dedicated to the art and science of red teaming. This project aims to serve as a central hub for red teamers, security researchers, and penetration testers by providing detailed information on vulnerabilities, practical checklists, advanced bypass techniques, diverse payloads, and a variety of red teaming techniques.

Red teaming plays a vital role in modern cybersecurity by simulating real-world attacks to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications. Our goal is to empower professionals with the knowledge and tools they need to conduct thorough and effective red team engagements.

In this repository, you will find:

Vulnerabilities: In-depth descriptions of various vulnerabilities, complete with identification methods, exploitation examples, and mitigation strategies.
Checklists: Comprehensive checklists covering every stage of red teaming engagements, from initial reconnaissance to post-exploitation activities.
Bypass Techniques: Detailed guides on how to evade security measures such as antivirus programs, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems.
Payloads: A diverse collection of payloads tailored for different scenarios, including reverse shells, web shells, and custom scripts, each documented with usage instructions and examples.
Techniques: A wide array of red teaming techniques, ranging from social engineering and network exploitation to lateral movement, all explained with practical examples.
We encourage community contributions to enhance the repository's value. If you have valuable information, scripts, or techniques to share, please review our contributing guidelines.
